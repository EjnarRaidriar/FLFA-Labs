## Theory

### Finite Automaton:

A finite automaton is a mathematical model of a finite-state machine. 
The state machine has a set of input symbols and jumps through the set of states based on the transition functions.

### Non-deterministic Finite Automata (NFA):

### Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA):

### Chomsky Hierarchy:

## Objectives:

1. Understand what an automaton is and what it can be used for.

2. Continuing the work in the same repository and the same project, the following need to be added:

    a. Provide a function in your grammar type/class that could classify the grammar based on Chomsky hierarchy.

    b. For this you can use the variant from the previous lab.

3. According to your variant number (by universal convention it is register ID), get the finite automaton definition and do the following tasks:

    a. Implement conversion of a finite automaton to a regular grammar.

    b. Determine whether your FA is deterministic or non-deterministic.

    c. Implement some functionality that would convert an NDFA to a DFA.
    
    d. Represent the finite automaton graphically (Optional, and can be considered as a __*bonus point*__).

## Implementation

* The fucntion _define_grammar({Grammar})_ defines the grammar according to Chomski classification.
In order to define it, the function uses exclusion method.
It goes through some checks in productions and eliminates grammars with stricter rules.
